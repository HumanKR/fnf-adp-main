This file just some credit for i using some opensources.
Maybe if i something missed in here, tell me what i missed to write.
Actually, I'm ashamed of myself for using a lot of opensource because I'm not good at it.

bbpanzu: endingstate code, some code about like... load dialogue2 file u know, cool swag tutorial video
SunSpirit(or Zeexel? Lumitic?): some custom note code
srPerez: some charting state code about ui
