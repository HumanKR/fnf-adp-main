# You know the Undertale!

I'm going to explain perhaps about who doesn't know

Sans and one of the three ending loots of Undertale that boss of the genocide ending is S.U.P.E.R.D.U.P.E.R.H.A.R.D

He dodge every attacks and full HP is 92, DPS of his attack is 60, even poisonous..

But anyone can't clear the boss like this Toby Fox made the critical weakness.

Sans's critical weakness is

# THE BEING EXHAUSTED.

After you dodge every patterns of Sans, he fall asleep while keeping his turn.

But when he sleeping, attack by moving screen, Sans dead because he dodge first attack, but he can't dodge second one.
